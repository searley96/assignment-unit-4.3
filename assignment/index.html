      <ul>I created a loop in the listItems function. It seems to be working, except
        I am getting a undefined value at the end of my list when I log it out. Not sure
        why this is happening, but it is appearing because of line 27 which is
        console.log(listItems(basket));
      </ul>
    </li>
